# TheLogicBand 
is an open source neural network architecture that was created by Derek Smith.

This architecture combines knowledge from the field of Neuroscience and the field of Data Science to further develop the
artificial intelligence "brain". This repository contains code that will show benchmark testing results on the standard
artificial neural network and the exact same model but enhanced with the Logic Band mechanism.

I reserve all rights to the contents of this repository as the developer of the architecture and code. As that creator I
grant usage of this architecture as open source software, however credit for intellectual innovation of The Logic Band is
reserved only for creator: Derek Smith, and use of core concepts and functionality, though allowed, must reference contribution
of intellectual innovation. Contact me for any questions dlsmith323@gmail.com
