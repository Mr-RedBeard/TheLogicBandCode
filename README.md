# TheLogicBand 
#is an open source neural network architecture that was created by Derek Smith.

#This architecture combines knowledge from the field of Neuroscience and the field of Data Science to further develop the
#artificial intelligence "brain". This repository contains code that will show benchmark testing results on the standard
#artificial neural network and the exact same model but enhanced with the Logic Band mechanism.

#I reserve all rights to the contents of this repository as the developer of the architecture and code. As that creator I
#grant usage of this architecture as open source software. Contact me for any questions dlsmith323@gmail.com
